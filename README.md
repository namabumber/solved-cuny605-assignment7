 <li>Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be n mutually independent random variables, each of which is uniformly distributed on the integers from 1 to k. Let Y denote the minimum of the Xi’s. Find the distribution of Y .</li>

 <li>Your organization owns a copier (future lawyers, etc.) or MRI (future doctors). This machine has a manufacturer’s expected lifetime of 10 years.  This means that we expect one failure every ten years.  (Include the probability statements and R Code for each part.).</li>

 <li>What is the probability that the machine will fail after 8 years?. Provide also the expected value and standard deviation.  Model as a geometric.  (Hint: the probability is equivalent to not failing during the first 8 years..)</li>
